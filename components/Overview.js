          Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of
          sadness and loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or
          clinical depression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can
          lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. You may have
          trouble doing normal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel
          as if life isnt worth living.

      <h2>Symptoms and patterns</h2>
      <div class="d2">
        <p>
          During a depressive episode, the person experiences depressed mood
          (feeling sad, irritable, empty) or a loss of pleasure or interest in
          activities, for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two
          weeks.
          <br />
          <br /> Several other symptoms are also present, which may include poor
          concentration, feelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth,
          hopelessness about the future, thoughts about dying or suicide,
          disrupted sleep, changes in appetite or weight, and feeling especially
          tired or low in energy.
          <br />
          <br />
          In some cultural contexts, some people may express their mood changes
          more readily in the form of bodily symptoms (e.g. pain, fatigue,
          weakness). Yet, these physical symptoms are not due to another medical
          condition.
          <br />
          <br />
          During a depressive episode, the person experiences significant
          difficulty in personal, family, social, educational, occupational,
          and/or other important areas of functioning.
          <br />
          <br />
          A depressive episode can be categorised as mild, moderate, or severe
          depending on the number and severity of symptoms, as well as the
          impact on the individuals functioning.
          <br />
          <br />

          <li>

            periods of manic symptoms, which include euphoria or irritability,
            increased activity or energy, and other symptoms such as increased
            talkativeness, racing thoughts, increased self-esteem, decreased
            need for sleep, distractibility, and impulsive reckless behaviour
